        I am a fresh graduate from the University of San Agustin with a degree in Computer Science, and former project manager of Google Student Developer Club - USA.

      I am a jack of all trades and is eager to learn and try anything that interests me in tech, from Web, Mobile, Game, and AI. Currently, I mainly focus on Full Stack Development, I use React, and NextJs for my Front End, Node and ExpressJS for the Back End, and I use either PostgreSQL for SQL Database or MongoDB for NoSQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have previous experience with mobile cross-platform before using Flutter and Firebase as a BaaS, alongside implementing a computer vision with it in my thesis project.
